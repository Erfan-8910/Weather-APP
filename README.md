# 🌦️ Modern Weather App (v2.0.0)

A high-performance, visually stunning weather application featuring a custom **Canvas Rendering Engine** and **Glassmorphism** UI. Built with vanilla JavaScript, it delivers real-time atmospheric simulations and accurate weather data without requiring an API key.

> **v2.0 Update:** Now features a physics-based particle engine, responsive dashboard layout, and smart day/night theming.

## 🚀 What's New in v2.0?

*   **🎨 Canvas Rendering Engine:** Rain and snow are now rendered using HTML5 Canvas for silky smooth 60FPS animations, replacing heavy DOM elements.
*   **🌬️ Physics-Based Weather:** Particles react to real-time wind speed! Stronger winds make rain and snow fall at an angle.
*   **🌗 Smart Day/Night System:** Fixed contrast issues. Text colors, backgrounds, and glass opacity automatically adjust for maximum readability in both bright sunlight and pitch-black nights.
*   **📱 Adaptive Dashboard:** A fully responsive grid layout that transforms from a mobile list view to a professional desktop dashboard.
*   **✨ Breathing Gradients:** Replaced static backgrounds with animated, breathing gradients and parallax effects.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **iOS-Inspired Design:** Clean typography (SF Pro style), frosted glass effects, and a minimalist interface.
*   **Real-Time Data (Powered by Open-Meteo):**
    *   Temperature & Real Feel
    *   Humidity & Wind Speed
    *   Atmospheric Pressure (New!)
    *   Hourly & 7-Day Forecast
*   **Dynamic Atmosphere:**
    *   Background gradients change based on weather conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow, Storm).
    *   **Parallax Effect:** Background moves subtly with your mouse cursor for a 3D feel.
*   **Smart Geocoding:** Search for any city worldwide with auto-focus and error handling.
*   **No API Key Required:** Plug and play! Uses the free Open-Meteo API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5 Canvas** (Particle System & Animation)
